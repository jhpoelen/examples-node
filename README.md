# MemCachier Node.js Example

This is an example Node.js app that uses
[MemCachier](http://www.memcachier.com) to cache values. This example
is written with node 0.6 and the express framework.

You can view a working version of this app
[here](http://memcachier-examples-node.herokuapp.com).
Running this app on your local machine in development will work as
well, although then you won't be using MemCachier -- you'll be using a
local dummy cache. MemCachier is currently only available with various
cloud providers.

Setting up MemCachier to work in Node is very easy.
